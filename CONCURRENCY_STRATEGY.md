USED  AI to write most of the tests, and these docs:

Here's a summary:

- Clone to your local, and run "docker compose up -d"
<!-- Install required items if this does not work for you -->


If you don't want to go the docker container way. Install a virtual environment with Python 3.9, and then activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate on mac)
- pip install -r requirements.txt to install requirements
- python manage.py makemigrations for creating migrations
- python manage.py migrate to apply these migrations.
- python manage.py runserver to run the server on localhost.
- Find swagger here: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/ ; and test all APIs; see all schemas and what not

Please note that it is advisable to delete the db.sqlite3 file : I have kept it so there is some data to start with even as you do it for the first time



Test for high concurrency/reliability/prevent overbooking case:
test_concurrent_booking_race_condition


What did I do? Created an atomic transaction with lock on row. I wanted to created a distributed lock with redis but unfortunately did not get enough time to set up redis here.

# Concurrency Handling Strategy

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The Event Scheduling System faces a critical concurrency challenge: **preventing overbooking** when multiple users simultaneously attempt to book the last available slot in an event.

### Race Condition Scenario
```
Time T1: User A checks event capacity (1 slot available)
Time T2: User B checks event capacity (1 slot available) 
Time T3: User A creates booking (successful)
Time T4: User B creates booking (overbooking occurs!)
```

Without proper concurrency handling, this race condition would allow the event to be overbooked, violating the business requirement that events cannot exceed their capacity.

## 🛡️ Solution Architecture

### 1. Database-Level Row Locking

The solution uses **database-level row locking** with Django's `select_for_update()` method to ensure atomic operations.

```python
@transaction.atomic
def create(self, validated_data):
    event = event.__class__.objects.select_for_update().get(id=event.id)
    if event.is_full:
        raise serializers.ValidationError({
            'event': 'This event is at full capacity. No more bookings available.'
        })
    booking = super().create(validated_data)
    return booking
```

### 2. Transaction Atomicity

The `@transaction.atomic` decorator ensures that the entire booking operation is atomic - either it completes entirely or rolls back completely.

### 3. Real-Time Capacity Calculation

Capacity is calculated dynamically based on active bookings:

```python
@property
def available_slots(self):
    active_bookings_count = self.bookings.filter(status='active').count()
    return max(0, self.capacity - active_bookings_count)
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Booking Creation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Database
    participant Event
    
    Client->>API: POST /bookingapi/booking/
    API->>Database: BEGIN TRANSACTION
    API->>Database: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE (lock event row)
    Database-->>API: Event row locked
    API->>Event: Check available_slots
    Event->>Database: COUNT active bookings
    Database-->>Event: Active booking count
    Event-->>API: Available slots calculated
    
    alt Event has available slots
        API->>Database: INSERT booking record
        Database-->>API: Booking created
        API->>Database: COMMIT TRANSACTION
        Database-->>API: Transaction committed
        API-->>Client: 201 Created
    else Event is full
        API->>Database: ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
        Database-->>API: Transaction rolled back
        API-->>Client: 400 Bad Request
    end
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Serializer-Level Concurrency Control
```python
# bookings/serializers.py
@transaction.atomic
def create(self, validated_data):
    user = self.context['request'].user
    validated_data['attendee'] = user.customer_profile
    event = validated_data['event']
    
    # Lock the event row to prevent concurrent modifications
    event = event.__class__.objects.select_for_update().get(id=event.id)
    
    # Re-check capacity after locking
    if event.is_full:
        raise serializers.ValidationError({
            'event': 'This event is at full capacity. No more bookings available.'
        })
    
    booking = super().create(validated_data)
    return booking
```

#### 2. Model-Level Capacity Management
```python
# events/models.py
@property
def available_slots(self):
    active_bookings_count = self.bookings.filter(status='active').count()
    return max(0, self.capacity - active_bookings_count)

@property
def is_full(self):
    return self.available_slots <= 0
```

#### 3. Business Logic Validation
```python
# bookings/serializers.py
def validate(self, attrs):
    event = attrs.get('event', getattr(self.instance, 'event', None))
    
    # Time-based validation
    if event.is_past:
        raise serializers.ValidationError({
            'event': 'Cannot book for events that have already ended.'
        })
    
    if event.is_ongoing:
        raise serializers.ValidationError({
            'event': 'Cannot book for events that are currently ongoing.'
        })
    
    # Duplicate booking prevention
    existing_booking = Booking.objects.filter(
        attendee__user=user,
        event=event,
        status='active'
    )
    
    if existing_booking.exists():
        raise serializers.ValidationError({
            'event': 'You already have an active booking for this event.'
        })
    
    return attrs
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests for Business Logic
```python
def test_create_booking_event_full(self):
    """Test that bookings are rejected when event is full."""
    # Fill the event
    for i in range(3):
        customer = Customer.objects.create(
            user=User.objects.create_user(username=f'fillercustomer{i}')
        )
        Booking.objects.create(
            attendee=customer,
            event=self.event,
            status='active'
        )
    
    # Attempt to book when full
    response = self.client.post(url, data)
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
    self.assertIn('full capacity', response.data['event'][0])
```

### 2. Concurrency Tests
```python
def test_concurrent_booking_race_condition(self):
    """Test that concurrent bookings don't exceed capacity."""
    results = []
    
    def create_booking(customer_index):
        try:
            customer = self.customers[customer_index]
            self.client.force_authenticate(user=customer.user)
            url = reverse('booking-list')
            data = {'event': self.event.id}
            response = self.client.post(url, data)
            results.append((customer_index, response.status_code))
        except Exception as e:
            errors.append((customer_index, str(e)))
    
    # Create threads for concurrent booking attempts
    threads = []
    for i in range(5):  # 5 customers trying to book for event with capacity 2
        thread = threading.Thread(target=create_booking, args=(i,))
        threads.append(thread)
    
    # Start all threads
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()
    
    # Wait for all threads to complete
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    
    # Verify results
    successful_bookings = [r for r in results if r[1] == status.HTTP_201_CREATED]
    self.assertEqual(len(successful_bookings), 2)  # Exactly capacity number
```

### 3. Edge Case Testing
```python
def test_booking_after_cancellation(self):
    """Test that booking becomes available after cancellation."""
    # Create and cancel booking
    booking = Booking.objects.create(attendee=self.customer, event=self.event)
    booking.cancel()
    
    # Verify slot is available
    self.assertEqual(self.event.available_slots, 1)
    
    # Create new booking
    response = self.client.post(url, data)
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### 1. Locking Strategy
- **Row-level locking**: Only locks the specific event row, not the entire table
- **Minimal lock duration**: Lock is held only during the critical booking operation
- **Fast validation**: Capacity calculation is optimized with database indexes

### 2. Database Optimization
```python
# bookings/models.py
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['attendee']),
        models.Index(fields=['event']),
        models.Index(fields=['status']),
    ]
    unique_together = [('attendee', 'event')]
```

### 3. Query Optimization
```python
# bookings/views.py
queryset = Booking.objects.select_related('attendee__user', 'event').all()
```

## 🔄 Cancellation and Reactivation

### Cancellation Flow
```python
def cancel(self):
    """Cancel the booking if it's still active and the event hasn't started."""
    if self.status != self.STATUS_ACTIVE:
        raise ValueError("Only active bookings can be cancelled.")
    
    if self.event.is_ongoing or self.event.is_past:
        raise ValueError("Cannot cancel booking for events that have already started or ended.")
    
    self.status = self.STATUS_CANCELLED
    self.save()
    return self
```

### Reactivation with Concurrency Control
```python
@transaction.atomic
def update(self, instance, validated_data):
    """Update booking with atomic transaction to prevent race conditions."""
    if (instance.status == 'cancelled' and 
        validated_data.get('status') == 'active'):
        
        event = validated_data.get('event', instance.event)
        
        # Lock the event row to prevent concurrent modifications
        event = event.__class__.objects.select_for_update().get(id=event.id)
        
        # Re-check capacity after locking
        if event.is_full:
            raise serializers.ValidationError({
                'event': 'This event is at full capacity. Cannot reactivate booking.'
            })
    
    return super().update(instance, validated_data)
```

## 🐛 Database-Specific Considerations

### SQLite (Development)
- **Limitations**: SQLite has limited concurrency support
- **Locking behavior**: May cause database locking errors in concurrent tests
- **Testing notes**: Tests include warnings about SQLite limitations

### PostgreSQL (Production)
- **Recommended**: Full ACID compliance and excellent concurrency support
- **Row-level locking**: `SELECT FOR UPDATE` works perfectly
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for locking operations

### Migration Strategy
```python
# settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',  # Development
        # 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',  # Production
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Logging Concurrency Events
```python
# bookings/views.py
HistoryPoint.log_action(
    user=request.user,
    action=HistoryPoint.ACTION_CREATE,
    obj=booking,
    details={
        'event_id': booking.event.id,
        'event_title': booking.event.title,
        'booking_date': booking.booking_date.isoformat(),
        'status': booking.status
    }
)
```

### 2. Database Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor active bookings per event
SELECT 
    e.title,
    e.capacity,
    COUNT(b.id) as active_bookings,
    e.capacity - COUNT(b.id) as available_slots
FROM events_event e
LEFT JOIN bookings_booking b ON e.id = b.event_id AND b.status = 'active'
GROUP BY e.id, e.title, e.capacity;
```

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Lock wait time**: Monitor how long requests wait for locks
- **Booking success rate**: Track successful vs failed booking attempts
- **Capacity utilization**: Monitor event capacity usage patterns

## 🚨 Error Handling

### 1. Concurrency Errors
```python
try:
    booking = serializer.save()
except serializers.ValidationError as e:
    if 'full capacity' in str(e):
        # Handle capacity exceeded
        return Response({'error': 'Event is full'}, status=400)
    raise
```

### 2. Database Lock Timeouts
```python
# In production, consider adding timeout handling
from django.db import OperationalError

try:
    booking = serializer.save()
except OperationalError as e:
    if 'timeout' in str(e).lower():
        return Response({'error': 'Request timeout, please try again'}, status=408)
    raise
```

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless API**: Can be scaled horizontally
- **Database connection pooling**: Handle increased concurrent connections
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple API instances

### 2. Caching Strategy
- **Event capacity caching**: Cache available slots (with invalidation on booking)
- **User booking cache**: Cache user's active bookings
- **Redis integration**: For high-performance caching

### 3. Queue-Based Processing
- **Async booking processing**: For high-volume scenarios
- **Background validation**: Process bookings in background queues
- **Event-driven architecture**: Notify users of booking status changes

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Transactions
```python
@transaction.atomic
def booking_operation():
    # All database operations within transaction
    pass
```

### 2. Lock Only What's Necessary
```python
# Good: Lock only the event row
event = Event.objects.select_for_update().get(id=event_id)

# Avoid: Locking entire table
events = Event.objects.select_for_update().all()
```

### 3. Validate After Locking
```python
# Always re-validate after acquiring lock
event = event.__class__.objects.select_for_update().get(id=event.id)
if event.is_full:
    raise ValidationError("Event is full")
```

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
```python
# Consider all possible states
if event.is_past or event.is_ongoing:
    raise ValidationError("Cannot book for this event")
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Concurrency Features
- **Optimistic locking**: Use version fields for conflict detection
- **Distributed locking**: Redis-based locking for microservices
- **Event sourcing**: Complete audit trail of all booking changes

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Read replicas**: Separate read/write databases
- **Connection pooling**: Optimize database connections
- **Query optimization**: Advanced indexing strategies

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Real-time monitoring**: Track booking patterns and anomalies
- **Automated alerts**: Notify when events approach capacity
- **Analytics dashboard**: Booking trends and capacity utilization
