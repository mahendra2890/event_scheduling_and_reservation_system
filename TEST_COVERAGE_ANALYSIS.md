USED  AI to write most of the tests, and these docs:

Here's a summary:

- Clone to your local, and run "docker compose up -d"
<!-- Install required items if this does not work for you -->


If you don't want to go the docker container way. Install a virtual environment with Python 3.9, and then activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate on mac)
- pip install -r requirements.txt to install requirements
- python manage.py makemigrations for creating migrations
- python manage.py migrate to apply these migrations.
- python manage.py runserver to run the server on localhost.
- Find swagger here: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/ ; and test all APIs; see all schemas and what not

Please note that it is advisable to delete the db.sqlite3 file : I have kept it so there is some data to start with even as you do it for the first time



Test for high concurrency/reliability/prevent overbooking case:
test_concurrent_booking_race_condition


What did I do? Created an atomic transaction with lock on row. I wanted to created a distributed lock with redis but unfortunately did not get enough time to set up redis here.
